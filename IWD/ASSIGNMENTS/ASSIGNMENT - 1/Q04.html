        <h2>My Favourite Teacher</h2>
        <p class="firstBigLatter">
            Teachers play an essential role in our life as an ideal teacher is responsible for the development of the
            students. I am a student of 10th Class of a reputed private school. There are many great teachers in my
            school,but my favourite teacher is Manish Sir. Manish Sir teaches us Maths, and he has a really personality.
            He is very polite and humble and we all the students love him.

            Manish Sir is tall and quite good looking. He is 32 years old and very experienced. His way of teaching is
            excellent. He believes in simple living and high thinking. All the students love him for his superb way of
            teaching and humble behaviour. He has an experience of 9 years in education, and he has done masters in
            Mathematics. He easily solves complicated mathematical equations and makes it very easy to understand for
            all students. He has all favourite teacher qualities in him.
