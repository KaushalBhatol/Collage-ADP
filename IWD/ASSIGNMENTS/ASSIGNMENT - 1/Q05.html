        <h2>My Favourite National Leader</h2>
        <p>
            There is no end to the choice of a favorite leader but as far as I am concerned, <b>Shri Lal Bahadur
                Shastri</b> is my favourite leader. He was born on October 2nd, 1904, at Mughalsarai, a town of UP. He
            belonged to a lower-middle-class family. He was born and brought up in the cradle of poverty

            Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri got his early education at Kashi Vidyapeeth. It was the place where he absorbed the
            rich springs of Indian culture and civilization. He molded his living according to the Indian way of life.
            After completing his education, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri turned to the poor condition of his countrymen
            under the British rule. He was deeply moved by the sufferings and miseries of his countrymen. Compelled by
            these circumstances, he joined the Indian freedom struggle. He came in contact with great Indian national
            leaders like Nehru, Gandhi, Patel and Subhas Chandra Bose. He worked hard and fought bravely in order to get
            his country liberated from the foreign rule. He became the member of the Servants of the Peopleâ€™s Society.
            He worked with many leaders who were organizing the national movement
